        <h2><u>History</u></h2>
      </div>
      <p>September 11, 2001, was a day of national tragedy. On that morning, the terrorist group Al-Qaeda carried out coordinated attacks in four locations, including the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. Two hijacked planes struck the Twin Towers, killing 2,753 people in New York. Twenty-four years later, the health impacts of that day are still unfolding. Thousands of survivors, first responders, and residents continue to experience a wide range of conditions, from mental health challenges to life-threatening diseases. Many illnesses linked to 9/11 exposure developed years after the attacks, leaving survivors in need of long-term medical monitoring and financial support. To meet this need, the federal government established the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) in 2011. The program provides medical treatment, monitoring, and financial assistance to those affected by the attacks, and now serves more than 130,000 people.</p>

        <h2><u>Who Qualifies?</u></h2>
      </div>
      <p>According to the CDC, eligibility is based on four factors: activity, location, time period, and hours of exposure. Applicants are categorized into four groups: WTC Survivors, WTC General Responders, FDNY personnel, and Pentagon/Shanksville Responders. People who lived, worked, went to school, or were present in the dust cloud in Lower Manhattan in the days and months following the attacks may qualify for coverage.</p>

      <p>The WTCHP covers a wide range of conditions, including but not limited to:</p>

        <li>Airway and Digestive Disorders: asthma, GERD, sleep apnea</li>
        <li>Cancers: thyroid, ovarian, breast, and others</li>

        <h2><u>The Future of the WTCHP</u></h2>
      </div>
      <p>Despite its reach, the program faces a funding crisis just as more people are being diagnosed with 9/11-related illnesses. Advocates warn that rising medical costs and inflation were not factored into the programâ€™s original budget. Earlier this year, the Trump administration reduced funding, though some cuts were later reversed. Still, projections show the WTCHP is on track to run short of money.</p>
      <p>In response, lawmakers introduced the 9/11 Responder and Survivor Health Funding Correction Act of 2025. The bill would adjust the funding formula to account for inflation and rising medical expenses, while also ensuring continued support for medical research. If passed, the bill would keep the program funded until its expiration in 2029. The bill is yet to pass.</p>
